I am an penultimate student at the University of Bristol, UK studying Engineering Mathematics (MEng).
As an aspiring data scientist with a profound interest for artificial intelligence, I look to the future with awe and wonders.
If there is one thing that I have learnt from studying the past, is that technology and science makes peoples life better,
and so I aspire to become a part of the future generation of researchers that can make the future even better.
I am seeking to work in the field of Autonomous Machines and Intelligent Systems, both in research and industry.
